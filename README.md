# Kaggle Learn: Intro to Machine Learning — My Solutions

This repository contains my completed exercises and notes from the [Kaggle Learn: Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) course.  
The focus of this course is to build intuition for how machine learning models work and to practice solving supervised learning problems using real datasets.

## 📘 About the Course
The *Intro to Machine Learning* micro-course provides a practical introduction to core ML concepts.  
It covers how to train, evaluate, and improve models on tabular datasets, with an emphasis on intuition and hands-on coding instead of heavy math.
